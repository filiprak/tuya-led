## About The Project

Tuya Led is a nifty little tool crafted for controlling your LED light strips straight from your Windows taskbar. It's like having a magic wand for your lights! With Tuya LED, you can tweak colors and switch the lights on and off in a snap, all from the comfort of your desktop. It's open-source, so feel free to dive in, tweak things, and make it even better!
